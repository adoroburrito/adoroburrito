### Hi, i'm AndrÃ©! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as a senior software engineer @ Delta Capita UK, mostly using JavaScript, both in the back-end (Node, TypeScript) and the front-end (React.js, Vue.js, Angular 2). In my free time I play guitar, study computer science, play around with toy projects in languages I like (Rust, Lua, OCaml, etc), look for ways to make my environment more effective + fast and make endless spotify playlists to share with friends!

Please see pinned repositories below for samples of my code, through my side projects!

Here is some more info:
